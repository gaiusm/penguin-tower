Gaius Mulley <gaiusmod2@gmail.com> wrote this code, the original
implementation was written during August 1985 and August 1986.  The
original code worked as an embedded application under MSDOS.  It
allowed three players, one on the console and two on the serial
devices com1 and com2.

Since then the code has been ported to GNU/Linux and extended to use
sockets and a Python3 Pygame front end.  Much of the original code
remains and most of the code could do with a rewrite and clean up.
Nevertheless it is pretty easy to extend and it also stresses the
GNU Modula-2 coroutines library.
